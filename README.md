## BRIEF
It has been 2 years since the `сообщение` binary has landed at the Khanty-Mansiysk Dark Eyes facility.  The world has slowly begun it's decent into madness.  The war in Ukraine has broken out and the Middle East as slowly begun to destabilize.  No one has seen or heard from the ANGLES OF DEATH since it has all begun.
The world has, but since forgotten their ways.  Will this be the end... <br><br>
P4r4d0x: "SPUD!  SPUD!  We found it!  We found what needs to be done for all!" <br><br>
Spud: "Woah P4r4d0x slow down, what did you find?" <br><br> 
P4r4d0x: "We cracked the `сообщение` binary we know what is going to happen.  Dark Eyes, is planning an attack.  They want to destabilize the world, and they are going to start with Eastern Europe!" <br><br>
Spud: "Have you been living under a rock?!  It's too late the attacks have already begun." <br><br>
Mainframe: (sounds of paper printing) <br><br>
Bets: "What is this?" <br><br>
P4r4d0x: "Crap it's more, plans!" <br><br>
Bets: "What plans?  And who are you?" <br><br>
P4r4d0x: "Sorry the name is P4r4d0x, I'm one of the REDAH Masters sent to help out with the `сообщение` binary.  I just cracked it this morning, and set up this system to capture new in coming messages, and you're holding the latest one." <br><br>
Bets: "Ah I must have missed you.  Good job, but as Spud said it's a bit too late, but lets at least see what they said...  Spud, get Z now this is not good!" <br><br>
Spud: "What could be so bad?" <br><br>
Bets: "No time just get Z now!" <br><br>
Spud: "Alright." <br><br>
Z: "I've been summoned?" <br><br>
Bets: "Yes, Z.  We have a major problem, Dark Eyes seems to be mobilizing again.  Thanks to P4r4d0x here we know what there messages are." <br><br>
Transmission: "Members of Dark Eyes, it has come to me attention that we may have interference with our systems.  We are enacting systems level ALPHA protocols.  You are to trust no one.
И в новом, и в старом мрак их косы преобладает над всем. - Д-р Ринн <br><br>
Spud: "This is bad... really bad.  What the hell is ALPHA level protocols?!" <br><br>
Mainframe: (beeping...) <br><br>
Bets: "What now?!" <br><br>
P4r4d0x: "It looks like a new binary, but what could it be?" <br><br>
Spud: "I don't know, but we better work fast." <br><br>
Arvinator: "It's their oldest most secure security level.  It predates all of our tools.  I thought it was only a myth, but I guess it's a real thing.  If that's the case, none of our tools are goign to work on this thing." <br><br>
Bets: "No time for that.  Spud take P4r4d0x and go figure out what this binary is.  Waste no time, I will send more REDAH masters to you once they arrive." <br><br>
Spud: "Damn this isn't good, we can't take another Ukraine level attack or worse.  P4r4d0x, you have any idea how to attack this thing?" <br><br>
P4r4d0x: "I have no idea, but we best start from the basics.  Look the REDAH Masters have arrived maybe one of them will have insight into this potentially ancient technology." <br><br>
